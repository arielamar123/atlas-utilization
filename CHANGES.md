This branch contains fixes and extensions to the ATLAS utilization pipeline
for processing ATLAS Open Data PHYSLITE files and producing invariant mass
histograms for the BumpNet anomaly detection algorithm.

## Summary of Changes

### Fix 18 — Remove obsolete global-range scan integration

Histograms now use fixed 0–10,000 GeV ranges in every batch, so the former
global min/max pre-scan is no longer required. The `--scan-only` CLI mode,
range-file configuration plumbing, and scan helpers have been removed. The
data and MC PBS workflows now schedule histogram creation directly after
post-processing, followed by the existing `hadd` merge step.

### Fix 17 — Histogram batch jobs not splitting SQLite files correctly (`histograms_pipeline.py`, `orchestration/handlers/histogram_creation_handler.py`, `main.py`, `domain/config.py`)

**Problem:** Multiple issues caused all histogram batch jobs to process all
processed SQLite files instead of their assigned slice, producing identical
histograms in each batch that hadd summed incorrectly:

1. `total_batch_jobs` was missing from the `config_dict` passed to
   `create_histograms` — without it, `_create_histograms_from_sqlite` could
   not split SQLite files by batch index.

2. `global_ranges_path` was not passed through `HistogramCreationHandler` to
   `create_histograms`, so `global_ranges` was always `None` and histograms
   used batch-local bin edges instead of the global ones from `global_ranges.json`.

3. `_create_histograms_from_sqlite` had no SQLite file splitting logic at all —
   it always read all SQLite files regardless of `batch_job_index`.

4. `batch_job_index` and `total_batch_jobs` were injected into
   `histogram_creation_task_config` in `main.py` but only after
   `update_config_paths_with_run_dir` was called, so the split never reached
   `PipelineConfig`.

5. `also_save_pre_postproc`, `pre_postproc_filename`, and `global_ranges_path`
   were not defined as fields in `HistogramCreationConfig` or read in
   `from_dict`, so YAML values were silently ignored.

**Fixes:**

- `histograms_pipeline.py`: added SQLite file splitting in
  `_create_histograms_from_sqlite` using `_get_batch_files` when
  `batch_job_index` and `total_batch_jobs` are present in config.

- `histogram_creation_handler.py`: added `total_batch_jobs` and
  `global_ranges_path` to the `config_dict` passed to `create_histograms`.

- `main.py`: inject `batch_job_index` and `total_batch_jobs` into
  `histogram_creation_task_config` alongside `output_filename`.

- `domain/config.py`: added `global_ranges_path`, `also_save_pre_postproc`,
  and `pre_postproc_filename` fields to `HistogramCreationConfig` dataclass
  and wired them through `from_dict`.


### Fix 12 — Histogram bin-edge mismatch across batches (`histograms_pipeline.py`, `executor.py`, `utils/paths.py`)

**Problem:** Each histogram batch job computed `global_min`/`global_max` from its
own data slice, producing histograms with different bin edges per batch. `hadd`
silently kept only the first batch's histogram and discarded the rest — e.g. for
`mass_m0m1j0_cat_2mx_1jx`, batch_1 had `nbins=33 min=59.8 max=397.5` while
batch_3 had `nbins=254 min=62.3 max=2598.7`. The merged file contained only
batch_1's 33 events instead of the true ~52,000.

**Fix:** Introduced a mandatory scan step between post-processing and histogram
creation. The scan reads all processed SQLite files, computes the true global
min/max per bumpnet signature across all batches and chunks, and writes
`logs/global_ranges.json`. All histogram batch jobs load this file and use
identical bin edges. `hadd` now merges correctly.

**New `--scan-only` mode** in `main.py` + `scan_global_ranges()` in `executor.py`:
```bash
python main.py --scan-only --run-dir /path/to/run_dir
```

**New helper functions** in `histograms_pipeline.py`:
```python
compute_global_ranges(sqlite_files, input_dir, exclude_outliers)
save_global_ranges(ranges, output_path)
load_global_ranges(path)
```

**`utils/paths.py`:** `update_config_paths_with_run_dir` now always sets
`global_ranges_path = {run_dir}/logs/global_ranges.json` automatically — no
manual config change needed.

**PBS job chain updated** (`submit_data.sh`, `submit_mc.sh`):

---

### Fix 13 — MC/data contamination in pipeline runs (`submit_data.sh`, `submit_mc.sh`, `main.py`)

**Problem:** Data and MC files were parsed into the same run directory. With
`parse_mc=False` the metadata cache still contained MC URLs (see Fix 11), and
the pipeline had no clean mechanism to enforce full separation at the run level.

**Fix:** Separated into two independent submission scripts:
- `submit_data.sh` — creates `{run_name}_data_{TIMESTAMP}/`, passes `--parse-mc false`
- `submit_mc.sh` — creates `{run_name}_mc_{TIMESTAMP}/`, passes `--parse-mc true`

Both scripts use the same config file. A new `--parse-mc true/false` CLI flag
overrides `parse_mc` in `parsing_task_config` at runtime without editing YAML:

```bash
# in submit_data.sh:
python -u main.py --config "${CONFIG}" --parse-mc false ...

# in submit_mc.sh:
python -u main.py --config "${CONFIG}" --parse-mc true ...
```

Both scripts implement the full 4-stage PBS chain from Fix 12.

---

### Fix 14 — Batch file deletion after hadd destroyed retry runs (`executor.py`)

**Problem:** `merge_outputs` called `bf.unlink()` on each `batch_N.root` file
after a successful `hadd`. On retry runs (e.g. after a failed batch job was
resubmitted), only the new batch file existed — `hadd` merged just 1 file instead
of all N, silently overwriting the previously correct merged file.

**Fix:** Batch files are now moved to `histograms/batch_files_archive/` instead
of deleted:
```python
archive_dir = Path(hist_dir) / "batch_files_archive"
archive_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
for bf in batch_roots:
    bf.rename(archive_dir / bf.name)
```

---

### Fix 15 — Stats aggregation crash on float-valued fields (`executor.py`)

**Problem:** `_aggregate_batch_stats` called `int(p[key])` on fields like
`total_size_mb` which are stored as floats (e.g. `'0.00'`), raising
`ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '0.00'`.

**Fix:** `int(float(p[key]))` — converts to float first, then truncates to int.

---

### Fix 16 — Memory crash in plot generation (`executor.py`)

**Problem:** `_read_parsed_data_stats` accumulated full per-event particle count
arrays (`particle_dists[ptype].extend(counts.tolist())`) across all 671 parsed
ROOT files. With millions of events per file this exhausted memory on the login
node, killing the process silently with no traceback.

**Fix:** Replaced array accumulation with immediate summation:
```python
counts = tree[branch_name].array(library="np")
particle_counts[ptype] = particle_counts.get(ptype, 0) + int(np.sum(counts))
del counts  # free immediately
```
`distributions` dict is now always empty — too large to store for runs of this size.

---

### Feature — Pre-post-processing histograms (`executor.py`, `histogram_creation_task_config`)

**Motivation:** Comparing histograms before and after post-processing is essential
for validating peak removal. 
**New config options:**
```yaml
histogram_creation_task_config:
  also_save_pre_postproc: true
  pre_postproc_filename: "atlas_opendata_nopostproc.root"
```

When enabled, the merge job reads all `im_arrays/*.sqlite` files (raw invariant
mass arrays, before peak removal) and writes a second ROOT file alongside the
main post-processed one. Produced in the merge step to avoid the bin-edge problem
— all data is visible at once, no batching required.

## Fix 11 — prevent MC/data contamination in metadata cache

**Problem:**The previous `_separate_mc_files` used `"mc" in url.lower()` which is
ambiguous — ATLAS Open Data URLs all contain "opendata", causing MC URLs
to be misclassified. With `parse_mc=False`, no separation happened at
all, so MC events were silently parsed as collision data.

**Modified files:**:
- fetcher.py: replace loose substring match with regex-based classifier
  (_classify_url) anchored to the dataset namespace component (mc<N>_,
  data<N>_). Separation now always happens unconditionally. Unclassifiable
  URLs raise ValueError immediately — no silent misrouting.
- fetcher.py: add _assert_no_cross_contamination() post-separation check
  as a safety net.
- fetch_metadata_handler.py: validate cache integrity on load; raise
  RuntimeError with first 5 violations if contaminated, forcing cache
  rebuild. Remove separate_mc argument from fetcher.fetch() call.
- parsing_handler.py: skip keys ending in _mc when parse_mc=False.
  parse_mc now means "include MC in the parsing run", not "separate in
  cache" (separation is always performed).
  
## Fix 10 — Sub-leading particle support

**Problem:** All combinations used only leading particles (highest pT).
`{"Electrons": 1}` always meant e₀. There was no way to compute e₁+j₀
(sub-leading electron + leading jet) as a separate invariant mass signature.

**Solution:** Combination values are now `(count, start_index)` tuples.
`start_index=0` = leading (unchanged behaviour); `start_index=1` = sub-leading.
Plain `int` values are still accepted via `get_count()` / `get_start()` helpers
for full backward compatibility.

**New config flags** (in `mass_calculation_task_config`):
```yaml
include_subleading: false   # set true to activate
max_subleading_index: 1     # highest rank index (1 = up to sub-leading)
```

**Impact:** With `max_subleading_index: 1`, enabling sub-leading expands
combinations from 65 → 308 (~4.7×). Walltime should be scaled accordingly.

**Modified files:** `combinatorics.py`, `physics_calcs.py`,
`im_calculator.py`, `im_pipeline.py`, `domain/config.py`, `config.yaml`

############################

### Fix 5 — max_total_particles_in_combination cap (`combinatorics.py`, `domain/config.py`, `mass_calculation_handler.py`)

**Problem:** With `min_particles_in_combination: 1`, the number of IM combinations
explodes to 624 (4 particle types, counts 1–4 each, no cap). Most high-multiplicity
combinations (e.g. 4e+4μ+4j+4γ = 16 particles) are unphysical and produce
negligible statistics, wasting mass calculation time.

**Fix:** Added `max_total_particles_in_combination` parameter that skips any
combination where the sum of particle counts exceeds the cap:

```python
# services/calculations/combinatorics.py
for counts in itertools.product(*count_ranges):
    if sum(counts) > max_total_particles:   # skip combinations exceeding particle cap
        continue
```

Configurable via yaml:
```yaml
mass_calculation_task_config:
  max_total_particles_in_combination: 4  # default; reduces 624 → 69 combinations
```

---

### Fix 6 — Post-processing: merge all chunks by FS_IM key before peak detection (`post_processing_pipeline.py`)

**Problem:** The post-processing pipeline iterated over individual signatures like
`parsed_2024r-pp_batch1_chunk0_FS_0e_0m_3j_0g_IM_j0j1j2`, processing each chunk
independently. This caused the peak finder to see partial distributions (e.g.
250k events from one chunk) rather than the full merged distribution (~2.5M
events across all chunks and batches). On sparse per-chunk distributions the
highest bin was often the low-mass turn-on, not the Z peak — leading to incorrect
peak removal.

**Fix:** Group all signatures by their `FS_IM` key (stripping the
`parsed_..._batch{N}_chunk{M}` prefix) before peak detection, then load and
concatenate all chunk arrays for that key:

```python
from collections import defaultdict
fs_im_groups = defaultdict(list)
for sig in signatures:
    m = re.search(r'(_FS_.+)', sig)
    fs_im_key = m.group(1) if m else sig
    fs_im_groups[fs_im_key].append(sig)

for fs_im_key in sorted(fs_im_groups.keys()):
    chunks = []
    for sig in fs_im_groups[fs_im_key]:
        for filename in sqlite_files:
            chunks.extend(iter_arrays_for_signature(..., sig))
    arr = np.concatenate(chunks)
    # peak detection on full merged array
```

**Result:** Peak detection now operates on the complete merged distribution,
correctly identifying the Z peak at ~91 GeV even for sparse final states.

---

### Fix 7 — Post-processing: use right edge of peak bin (`post_processing_pipeline.py`)

remove Fix 7 — peak bin right-edge shift had no effect

The peak_bin_idx + 1 change (right edge instead of left edge of peak bin)
did not solve the post-processing problem. Root cause is elsewhere.
Reverting to original behavior pending proper fix.

---

### Fix 8 — Post-processing: periodic SQLite commits (`post_processing_pipeline.py`)

**Problem:** The original code called `writer.commit()` only once after processing
all signatures. With 3.7M signatures this produced an 8 GB SQLite WAL file that
was rolled back entirely on job kill — losing all progress.

**Fix:** Commit every 1000 signatures:

```python
COMMIT_EVERY = 1000
processed = 0
for fs_im_key in sorted(fs_im_groups.keys()):
    # ... process ...
    processed += 1
    if processed % COMMIT_EVERY == 0:
        writer.commit()
        logger.info(f"Post-processing progress: {processed}/{len(fs_im_groups)} signatures committed")
writer.commit()  # final commit for remainder
```

**Result:** WAL stays small (~few MB), and at most 1000 signatures worth of work
is lost on job kill.

### Fix 9 — Skip single-particle combinations in combinatorics (`combinatorics.py`)

Added a guard in `get_all_combinations` to reject combinations where the total
particle count is less than 2. A single-particle "combination" produces a trivial
invariant mass equal to the particle's own mass, which is physically meaningless
for bump hunting. Previously, such combinations could pass the `max_total_particles`
filter and propagate through the mass calculation, generating spurious signatures
(e.g. `1e_0m_0j_0g`) that inflate the histogram count without any signal sensitivity.

**Change:** `if sum(counts) < 2: continue`
**Result:** Combinatorics now only generates signatures with ≥ 2 particles

---

### Fix 1 — Index-based IM naming (`im_pipeline.py`, `histograms_pipeline.py`)

**Problem:** The pipeline used count-based naming for invariant mass combinations,
e.g. `IM_2e_0m_1j_0g`, which is ambiguous — it does not specify *which* particles
were used (leading vs sub-leading). BumpNet expects index-based naming starting
from 0 (e.g. `e0`, `e1`, `j0`).

**Fix:** Two functions were updated:
- `prepare_im_combination_name` in `services/pipelines/im_pipeline.py`
- `_convert_to_bumpnet_name` in `services/pipelines/histograms_pipeline.py`

**Result:**

| Old signature | New signature | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `IM_1e_0m_1j_0g` | `IM_e0j0` | leading e + leading j (2-body) |
| `IM_2e_0m_1j_0g` | `IM_e0e1j0` | both e + leading j (3-body) |
| `IM_1e_0m_2j_0g` | `IM_e0j0j1` | leading e + both j (3-body) |

Histogram names follow the same convention:
`ROI_mass_e0j0_cat_1ex_0mx_1jx_0gx_width_10.0`

---

### Fix 2 — Kinematic cuts in MeV (`config.yaml`)

**Problem:** ATLAS PHYSLITE stores all 4-vector quantities (pt, mass, energy) in
MeV. The original config used `pt_min: 25.0`, which meant 25 MeV — effectively
no cut, passing all soft particles and producing unphysical invariant masses.

**Fix:** Config updated to use MeV values:

```yaml
kinematic_cuts:
  electrons: { pt_min: 25000.0, eta_max: 2.47 }  # 25 GeV in MeV
  muons:     { pt_min: 25000.0, eta_max: 2.5  }
  jets:      { pt_min: 30000.0, eta_max: 4.5  }
  photons:   { pt_min: 25000.0, eta_max: 2.37 }
```

The `_convert_array_to_gev()` function (`* 1e-3`) in `im_pipeline.py` correctly
converts MeV → GeV for the final invariant mass values stored in SQLite.

---

### Fix 3 — Memory leak in `parsing_handler.py`

**Problem:** After writing each parsed ROOT chunk to disk, the Python `EventChunk`
object (holding large awkward arrays) was not explicitly freed. Python's garbage
collector does not release memory promptly, causing memory to grow continuously
throughout a long parsing job — reaching 150+ GB for a 72-hour run over 70,201
files.

**Fix:** Added explicit memory release after each chunk write:

```python
import gc

# After _save_chunk_to_root(chunk, ...):
del chunk
gc.collect()

# After _save_chunk_to_root(final_chunk, ...):
del final_chunk
gc.collect()
```

The ROOT files on disk are unaffected — only the in-memory Python object is freed.

## Known Issues / Pending Work

### Electron isolation cuts (not yet implemented)
Without isolation cuts, fake electrons from jets dominate the electron
channel. The `2ex_0mx_1jx_0gx` final state has only ~1 event across
all 524 data chunks because real Z→ee+1j events are buried under
high-multiplicity fake-electron final states. Standard ATLAS isolation:
- `ptvarcone30_Nonprompt_All_MaxWeightTTVALooseCone_pt1000 / pt < 0.06`
- `topoetcone20 / pt < 0.06`

### _split_by_first_empty_bin truncates sparse distributions
For final states with low statistics (e.g. 2μ+1j), the first empty bin
occurs early in the high-mass tail, causing the postproc histogram to
be truncated. Use `exclude_outliers: false` in histogram creation to
include the full distribution above the Z peak cut.
